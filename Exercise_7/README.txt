In this exercise the goal is to implement Swagger.
The focus of this exercise is to understand and use Swagger as a means of documenting your API.
In this exercise the basic implementation has already been implemented as an example. The descriptions for the UserDTO + controller, RoleDTO + controller and AuthorityDTO + controller have been created as well, use those as examples to descripe your custom built endpoints. 

For that follow these steps:
1. Make sure you've defined the necessary gradle dependencies
2. Create the new file SpringFoxConfig and create it accordingly to the    provided example.
3. Create the swagger.yaml file, which is found under resources in the    example, and describe the endpoints and DTOs.
